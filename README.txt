This grails plugin allows you to create customer invoices on the Freeagent web based accounting software.

It's not a complete implementation of the Freeagent API.  You can do the following things:

- Create/Update/Delete contacts (these can be customers or suppliers)
- Create/Update/Delete invoices and lines

Additional functionality may be added as I have a need for it.
